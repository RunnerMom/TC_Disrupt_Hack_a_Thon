 @RunnerMom and I built Fashionable Holiday during the TechCrunch Disrupt 2013 Hack-a-thon in San Francisco. 

 Fashionable Holiday is a web app that integrates the Wunderground and Shopstyle APIs to provide clothing recommendations for travel destinations based on the weather. We also utilized Python, Flask, Jinja, JQuery, CSS and HTML.

 After little sleep and lots of coffee, we presented in front of hundreds of hackers on Sunday morning - watch the viedo here: http://on.aol.com/video/fashionable-holiday-demo-at-hackathon-sf-2013-517925592
